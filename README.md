# CleanGUI
Minimalist, simple and customizable graphical user interface, inspired by Dear ImGui. Made in pure standard C, only using OpenGL as renderer. 

CleanGUI is designed to be used side by side with OpenGL, therefore it is compatible with any helper API, such as GLFW or SDL. All you need to do to start using CleanGUI is provide a valid OpenGL context!
