# CleanGUI
Minimalist, simple and customizable graphical user interface, inspired by Dear ImGui. Made in pure standard C, only using OpenGL as renderer. 

CleanGUI is designed to be used side by side with OpenGL, therefore it is compatible with any helper API, such as GLFW or SDL. All you need to do to start using CleanGUI is provide a handle to a window with a valid OpenGL context!

For now CleanGUI is only available for Windows. Linux and MacOS compatibillity will be added after the first release!
