# CleanGUI
Minimalist, simple and customizable graphical user interface, inspired by Dear ImGui. Made in pure standard C, using OpenGL as renderer with only GLFW as dependency. 

CleanGUI is designed to be used side by side with OpenGL. All you need to do to start using it is provide a GLFW window with a valid OpenGL context!
